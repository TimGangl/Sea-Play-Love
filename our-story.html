              <div class="the-story mt-5">
                <p>We purchased this cabin after moving our Mother/Mother-in-law
                  out from Dover Delaware in April of 2018 to her new home in Whaleshead Resort in
                  Brookings, Oregon. Here's the full story. TL:DR at the bottom.</p>
                <p>Our Mother had gone on a roadtrip some years prior with her
                  daughters, and came upon a quaint little resort in Southern Oregon. Everyone
                  fell in love with this place and it was always a place to go back and visit.
                  Fast forward a couple of years, and there's another roadtrip, but only with the
                  daughter that lived in Dover with her. The trip ended back at Whaleshead Resort,
                  and she purchased her new home. After trying to figure out how to move her, two
                  overly large dachshunds- Molly and Annie, and an independent cat named Red,
                  across country, we decided that driving her out would be the best course of
                  action. So we booked the flights, planned the best route, and got everything
                  prepped for a 4-day trip across the country.</p>
                <p>We arrived in Dover and after a final meal at Cheddar's, we
                  packed the final items into her car. Luckily, she had a big enough vehicle to
                  accommodate everything we'd need for the roadtrip, plus all the animals and
                  their provisions. We spend the rest of the night packing things into the car
                  that will be our surroundings for the next 4 days.</p>
                <p>The next morning, we wake up, and get ready to return the
                  rental car. We had to be sure the cat was contained in the house because he
                  liked to wander during the day and return at night. Well, somehow, the stupid
                  cat got out and the chase was on. We decided to divide and conquer, so two of us
                  headed out to return the rental car, and the others stayed to corral the cat.
                  Rental return was super easy, and we got word that the cat had been put in his
                  cage. He had a large cage that contained everything he needed. We put him in the
                  back of the car, said our goodbyes and we were finally ready to start our
                  journey. Little did we realize, but the car door was left open all night while
                  we were doing last-minute packing, and the battery was dead. So we found jumper
                  cables, but had no idea where the battery was. After a bit of Googling, we were
                  successful in jumping the car and NOW, we were on our way.</p>
                <p>Our first day took us through Delaware, Maryland,
                  Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and finally to our first hotel in Effingham,
                  Illinois. Overall, the first day went by quickly and we were able to see some
                  nice sites along the way. Dinner was basically from a vending machine, pizza,
                  snacks, drinks.</p>
                <p>We were up early to get the second day started and after
                  getting gas, we were back on the road. We got to stop and see the St. Louis
                  Arch, the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, and a whole lotta flat land across
                  Kansas. We passed through Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, and finally pulled into
                  Denver, Colorado as it was getting dark. Luckily, the hotel had a decent
                  restaurant, so we enjoyed a nice dinner at the bar.</p>
                <p>The next morning was cold and sprinkling. Headed north out of
                  Denver into Wyoming, where we got snowed on, and finally down to Salt Lake City,
                  Utah. Got gas in SLC, then straight across past The Great Salt Lake and into
                  Winnemucca, Nevada. After checking in to our hotel, we found a Denny's for
                  dinner, then back to get a well-deserved good nights rest. Now, normally, I hang
                  up my clothes so they're not on the floor, but the day was so tiring, clothes
                  just ended up where ever they landed.</p>
                <p>Our last morning before our final destination, we were up
                  early. Took a shower, and put my pants on. I thought I put them in a puddle of
                  water near the shower, but something told me that it wasn't water. Yup, the cat,
                  that I had been so sympathetic to the whole trip so far, had peed on my pants.
                  Luckily, it was warm enough outside for me to put on my shorts. For the rest of
                  the trip, if the stupid cat would meow, instead of giving comforting words, all
                  he got was, &quot;Deal with it!&quot; Headed north into Oregon and we finally
                  arrived in Brookings around dinner time after 3,138 miles across the country.
                  Got to the house and unpacked as much as we could. We had rented a cabin that
                  was close so that we could assist in whatever Mom needed. The truck full of
                  furniture finally arrived a couple of days later, and most everything survived
                  the trip.</p>
                <p>We went back several times over the next couple of months, and
                  renting a cabin was costing a lot of money. So we started looking at purchasing
                  a cabin so we would have a place to stay when we visited, plus, we could rent it
                  out when we weren't there. We needed a name for the cabin, and came up with
                  SeaPlayLove. It was just a natural extension to call our art by the same name.
                  When you stay at the cabin, you can see some of our art in the cabin, the lobby,
                  and in a little store in town, Ambience by the Sea.</p>
                <p>How did we get started making art? Well, the paper artwork in
                  the cabin was all faded, yellowed, or moldy, from being exposed to the salt air.
                  We wanted to put in something that would not be so affected by the damp, salt,
                  air. Trisha found an art resin piece online and purchased it. When it arrived,
                  it was smaller than we thought, and seemed expensive for the size. So Trisha
                  said to herself, &quot;Hmmm...I can do this!&quot; And after many hours of
                  research and experimentation, she made her first resin wave piece. It hangs over
                  the sink at the cabin and a reminder of where we started. From there, we have
                  branched out to mermaids, ocean life, nature, and even furniture.
                </p>
                <p>TL:DR Drove the Mother out from Delaware to Brookings over 4 days. Bought a
                  cabin in the resort so we could have a place to stay when we visited. Needed to
                  replace the art in the cabin and ended up starting a business!</p>
