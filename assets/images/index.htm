<p align="center">Traveling to Oregon? Rent our cabin.
<a href="https://www.whalesheadresort.com/" target="_blank">Visit Whaleshead Resort</a> 
and search for OV-3.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">We purchased this cabin after moving our Mother/Mother-in-law
out from Dover Delaware in April of 2018 to her new home in Whaleshead Resort in
Brookings, Oregon. Here's the full story. TL:DR at the bottom.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Our Mother had gone on a roadtrip some years prior with her
daughters, and came upon a quaint little resort in Southern Oregon. Everyone
fell in love with this place and it was always a place to go back and visit.
Fast forward a couple of years, and there's another roadtrip, but only with the
daughter that lived in Dover with her. The trip ended back at Whaleshead Resort,
and she purchased her new home. After trying to figure out how to move her, two
overly large dachshunds- Molly and Annie, and an independent cat named Red,
across country, we decided that driving her out would be the best course of
action. So we booked the flights, planned the best route, and got everything
prepped for a 4-day trip across the country.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">We arrived in Dover and after a final meal at Cheddar's, we
packed the final items into her car. Luckily, she had a big enough vehicle to
accommodate everything we'd need for the roadtrip, plus all the animals and
their provisions. We spend the rest of the night packing things into the car
that will be our surroundings for the next 4 days.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">The next morning, we wake up, and get ready to return the
rental car. We had to be sure the cat was contained in the house because he
liked to wander during the day and return at night. Well, somehow, the stupid
cat got out and the chase was on. We decided to divide and conquer, so two of us
headed out to return the rental car, and the others stayed to corral the cat.
Rental return was super easy, and we got word that the cat had been put in his
cage. He had a large cage that contained everything he needed. We put him in the
back of the car, said our goodbyes and we were finally ready to start our
journey. Little did we realize, but the car door was left open all night while
we were doing last-minute packing, and the battery was dead. So we found jumper
cables, but had no idea where the battery was. After a bit of Googling, we were
successful in jumping the car and NOW, we were on our way.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Our first day took us through Delaware, Maryland,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and finally to our first hotel in Effingham,
Illinois. Overall, the first day went by quickly and we were able to see some
nice sites along the way. Dinner was basically from a vending machine, pizza,
snacks, drinks.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">We were up early to get the second day started and after
getting gas, we were back on the road. We got to stop and see the St. Louis
Arch, the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, and a whole lotta flat land across
Kansas. We passed through Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, and finally pulled into
Denver, Colorado as it was getting dark. Luckily, the hotel had a decent
restaurant, so we enjoyed a nice dinner at the bar.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">The next morning was cold and sprinkling. Headed north out of
Denver into Wyoming, where we got snowed on, and finally down to Salt Lake City,
Utah. Got gas in SLC, then straight across past The Great Salt Lake and into
Winnemucca, Nevada. After checking in to our hotel, we found a Denny's for
dinner, then back to get a well-deserved good nights rest. Now, normally, I hang
up my clothes so they're not on the floor, but the day was so tiring, clothes
just ended up where ever they landed.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Our last morning before our final destination, we were up
early. Took a shower, and put my pants on. I thought I put them in a puddle of
water near the shower, but something told me that it wasn't water. Yup, the cat,
that I had been so sympathetic to the whole trip so far, had peed on my pants.
Luckily, it was warm enough outside for me to put on my shorts. For the rest of
the trip, if the stupid cat would meow, instead of giving comforting words, all
he got was, &quot;Deal with it!&quot; Headed north into Oregon and we finally
arrived in Brookings around dinner time after 3,138 miles across the country.
Got to the house and unpacked as much as we could. We had rented a cabin that
was close so that we could assist in whatever Mom needed. The truck full of
furniture finally arrived a couple of days later, and most everything survived
the trip.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">We went back several times over the next couple of months, and
renting a cabin was costing a lot of money. So we started looking at purchasing
a cabin so we would have a place to stay when we visited, plus, we could rent it
out when we weren't there. We needed a name for the cabin, and came up with
SeaPlayLove. It was just a natural extension to call our art by the same name.
When you stay at the cabin, you can see some of our art in the cabin, the lobby,
and in a little store in town, Ambience by the Sea.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">How did we get started making art? Well, the paper artwork in
the cabin was all faded, yellowed, or moldy, from being exposed to the salt air.
We wanted to put in something that would not be so affected by the damp, salt,
air. Trisha found an art resin piece online and purchased it. When it arrived,
it was smaller than we thought, and seemed expensive for the size. So Trisha
said to herself, &quot;Hmmm...I can do this!&quot; And after many hours of
research and experimentation, she made her first resin wave piece. It hangs over
the sink at the cabin and a reminder of where we started. From there, we have
branched out to mermaids, ocean life, nature, and even furniture.</font></p>
<p>TL:DR Drove the Mother out from Delaware to Brookings over 4 days. Bought a
cabin in the resort so we could have a place to stay when we visited. Needed to
replace the art in the cabin and ended up starting a business!</p>
